        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.1rem; color: #555;">for Moldy (Food Freshness Checker)</p>

        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 26, 2025</p>

        <div class="header-info">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Developer:</strong> Younen</li>
                <li><strong>App Name:</strong> Moldy (Food Freshness Checker)</li>
                <li><strong>Package ID:</strong> <code>com.czups.moldy</code></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
            This Privacy Policy describes how Moldy ("we," "us," or "our") handles
            information when you use our mobile application. We are committed to
            protecting your privacy. This app is designed to be fully anonymous and
            does not collect, store, or share any of your personal information.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Data We Do NOT Collect</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>We want to be crystal clear: Moldy does not collect any personal data.</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>No User Accounts:</strong> The app does not require you to create
                an account, log in, or provide any personal information (like your
                name, email address, or phone number).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>No Personal Information:</strong> We do not collect, store, or
                transmit any personally identifiable information.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>No Location Data:</strong> The app does not access, collect, or
                use your device's location (GPS or network-based).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>No Device Identifiers:</strong> We do not collect unique device
                identifiers (like IMEI, Android ID, or Advertising ID).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>No Analytics or Tracking:</strong> We do not use any first-party
                or third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising SDKs (such as
                Google Analytics, Firebase, or AdMob).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Permissions and Data Processing</h2>
        <p>
            Moldy requires two permissions to function. Here is an explanation of
            why they are needed and how any data is handled.
        </p>

        <h3>a) Camera & Photo Library Access (Optional)</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Purpose:</strong> To provide the core app functionality, which is
            analyzing the freshness of a food item. You can either take a new
            photo of your food using the <code>Camera</code> or select an existing
            photo from your device's <code>Gallery/Photos</code>.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Data Handling:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>You select or capture an image.</li>
            <li>
                The image is sent securely using HTTPS to our backend API for
                analysis.
            </li>
            <li>
                The API's AI model analyzes the image and returns a freshness
                classification (e.g., "fresh" or "rotten") and a confidence score.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The image is deleted from the server immediately after the
                analysis is complete. We do not store your photos on our
                servers.</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                The image is not stored within the app's private storage after
                analysis.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>
            b) Internet Access (<code>android.permission.INTERNET</code>)
        </h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Purpose:</strong> Internet access is required to securely send the
            food image to our backend API for AI analysis and to receive the
            analysis result.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Data Handling:</strong> All communication with our API is encrypted
            using HTTPS. We use the OkHttp library for this network communication.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Data Processing</h2>
        <p>
            To perform the AI analysis, Moldy uses a backend API.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Service Provider:</strong> Our backend AI model is hosted on
                <strong>Railway.app</strong> (US-based servers).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>API Endpoint:</strong>
                <code>https://food-freshness-api-moldy-production.up.railway.app</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Purpose:</strong> Railway.app acts as our data processor. It
                hosts the AI model that receives the image, performs the inference,
                and sends back the result.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Data Policy:</strong> As the data controller, we have instructed
                the service to <strong>delete all user-submitted images immediately
                after processing.</strong> No images or analysis results are stored or
                logged on the server. Railway.app may collect standard, non-personal
                server logs (such as IP addresses) for its own security, debugging,
                and operational purposes, which is standard practice for any
                internet server. We do not have access to this data.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>On-Device:</strong> The app does not store your photos or any
                personal data on your device.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>On-Server:</strong> User-submitted photos are processed in
                real-time and are <strong>deleted immediately</strong> from the
                server's memory. They are never written to disk or stored in a
                database.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. User Rights</h2>
        <p>
            Since we do not collect any personal information or create user
            accounts, there is no personal data for you to access, correct, or
            delete. You can revoke the app's permissions (Camera, Photos) at any
            time through your device's system settings. You can completely remove
            the app and any associated data by uninstalling it from your device.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            We do not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone,
            including children. The app's analysis is anonymous and does not store
            data.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you
            of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are
            advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
        </p>
